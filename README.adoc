= Gemlist

I built `gemlist` because I wanted a programmatic way to do what http://github.com/samphippen/dundler[dundler] does:

. Figure out what gems would be installed by a given project
. Give each one a separate `RUN gem install $name -v $version` line in a Dockerfile

I want this capability because a containerization tool I work on builds Docker images from template-generated Dockerfiles, and it'd be nice to not have to wait for `nokogiri` to re-install every time we need to re-containerize a Rails application (as an example).

Given this, I have a very specific set of assumptions:

* I don't care about local (`path => ...`) dependencies.
* I don't care about git (`git => ...`) dependencies.
* I do care about being able to include or exclude bundle groups.
* I don't actually want to install gems, just get a list of them.
* I have local filesystem access to the Gemfile and Gemfile.lock of the target project.

If these assumptions line up with a problem you're trying to solve, then I hope this saves you time and energy! And, if it does, feel free to contact me, because I'd be interested in hearing about the super-cool thing you're doing with this.

== Use

```ruby
require 'gemlist'

gemlist = Gemlist.new("/path/to/project")

gemlist.gems.each do |gem|
  puts "RUN gem install #{gem.name} -v #{gem.version}"
end
```

If you want to exclude gem groups, you can do that:

```ruby
gemlist = Gemlist.new("/path/to/project", without: [:development, :test])
```

If you want to include addition gem groups, you can do that too:

```ruby
gemlist = Gemlist.new("/path/to/project", with: [:assets])
```

== Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'gemlist'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install gemlist

== Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to link:https://rubygems.org[rubygems.org].
